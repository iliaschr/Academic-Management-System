# Academic Management System (AMS)

## Description
The Academic Management System is a C++ project designed to manage students, professors, and courses in an academic environment. It provides an intuitive, menu-driven interface for secretaries to handle various administrative tasks, including adding, editing, and removing records, enrolling students in courses, managing grades, and more.

This project was developed as a team assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, showcasing the practical application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features
- Student Management: Add, edit, remove, and view students. Manage their course enrollments, grades, and attendance.
- Professor Management: Add, edit, remove, and view professors. Assign them to courses.
- Course Management: Create, modify, and delete courses. Assign professors and enroll students.
- Grade Management: Allow professors to assign grades and view student performance.
- Graduation Requirements: Identify students eligible for graduation based on mandatory requirements.
- Semester Control: Manage academic semester settings, such as switching between semesters and setting exam periods.
- File Export: Save lists of students who passed specific courses into a text file.

## Technical Highlights
- Developed entirely in **C++** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Implements **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **operator overloading**, and **friend functions** for efficient system modeling.
- Includes a well-structured `Makefile` for building, running, and debugging the project.
- Memory management verified using **Valgrind** to ensure no memory leaks.

## Requirements
- Compiler: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- C++ Standard: C++11 or later

## Build Instructions
1. To compile: make
2. To run: make run
3. To clean up: make clean

You can also use valgrind.
